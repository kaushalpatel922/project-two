How to use the app:
Search for any US companies stock symbol/ticker and you will see the current stock price and other financial information about the company.

APIs:
I have used Yahoo Finance and Trading View Chart API.

Languages:
I have used HTML, CSS, Javascript and HandleBars.

Process:
This was an interesting project, where I got to practice the design and code from start to end and display the necessary information using two different APIs.

Challenges:
 - Using Yahoo Finance API - different query request

Final Thoughts:
I am now a lot more comfortable using various APIs. After practicing with Yahoo Finance API and the layout design, feel a sigh of relief but ongoing process to learn new things.
